# MY FIRST BLOG POST

Okay, so yeah. I will be starting a blog post. Probably, I will be blogging mostly
about stuff connected to computer science and/or machine learning, but we'll see.

Why?

Well, I have some ideas that I want to write somewhere, and I am not a big fan
of using dead trees for the purpose so... I also want to take some notes while
learning new stuff and it's too much to put as comments in between lines of code,
so I figured a blog might be a good idea.

I was also inspired by some people that were comparing working in industry vs
working in academia. A common theme was that keeping a blog could be distantly
compared to having a body of research work. Of course you are not at the cutting
edge of science, but still, depending on how deep you want to dive, a blog post
might be considered a reasonable research effort.

Hopefully, with time, my posts will improve both in quantity and in quality.
Keeping them sorted by date would definitely help to see how much progress I am
making.

The End
