# Hey!

Hi there. Here is @pi-tau.

By day I am a software developer writing microservices in Go. And by night I
like to implement and train deep learning models. I hold a master's degree in AI
and my interests lie mostly in the fields of reinforcement learning and
generative modelling. Feel free to checkout some of my public repos
(
    [RL](https://github.com/pi-tau/playing-with-RL-models),
    [VAE](https://github.com/pi-tau/vae),
    [PixelCNN](https://github.com/pi-tau/pixelcnn/blob/master/pixelcnn.py)
).

As you can probably tell I don't often socialize with people, and would rather
sit in front of the pc, than go out for a beer (or ten). Anyway, this blog is
mostly about AI/ML/DL and my endeavors trying to enter the field. I have found
that reading a paper on a given topic rarely gives you the whole picture (not
even close). So I try to dig deeper into the whys and hows and occasionally make
a blog post about it.
