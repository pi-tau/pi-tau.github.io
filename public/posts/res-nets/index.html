        <p>The ResNet was introduced in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385">paper</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
<em>&ldquo;Deep residual learning for image recognition&rdquo;</em> by Kaiming He et al. in 2015.
So what is the problem that its design was trying to solve? My first thought was
that it improves gradient flow and allows for easier training of much deeper
models, but that&rsquo;s not it. The problem with vanishing/exploding gradients was
already solved with techniques like
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167">batch normalization</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and smart

<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01852">initialization</a><sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>There is however a more subtle problem with designing deeper networks. And that
is: <em>How do we know that a deeper network would fit the data better?</em> And this
is not about larger models overfitting the data and performing worse. We are
talking about the accuracy of the model during <strong>training</strong>. Experiments show
that performance actually starts to degrade when networks become too deep, as
shown on the figure:</p>
<p>

    <figcaption><small>Training a 20-layer and a
56-layer networks on CIFAR-10. The figure is adapted from [1]</small></figcaption>
  </figure>

</p>
<p>In theory, the deeper network should be able to learn the function represented
by the shallower network &ndash; the last 36 layers should simply be reduced to an
identity mapping. However, it turns out that, using current gradient based
methods, it is not that easy to make some arbitrary part of a highly non-linear
network learn to simulate the identity function. Thus, if we simply stack more
layers, then we might not be able to recover solutions achievable with fewer
layers. And so it might happen that deeper networks actually have higher
training error.</p>
<p>(Note that we might simply be having issues optimizing the larger model because
batch norm and weight init are not doing a good job :? But the assumption is
that they are doing a good job.)</p>
<h2 id="the-residual-block-empowering-deeper-networks">THE RESIDUAL BLOCK: EMPOWERING DEEPER NETWORKS<a href="#the-residual-block-empowering-deeper-networks" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Simply stacking one more layer on top of our current model results in applying
a function $F(x)=f(x)$ to the output of our model $x$. The paper proposes to
change the wiring of our network by adding a shortcut connection so that
$F(x)=f(x)+x$. Now if the deeper model wants to reproduce the shallower model we
simply have to learn that the residual is $f(x)=0$, i.e., push the weights to 0.
And the hypothesis is that learning $f(x)=0$ should be much easier than learning
$f(x)=x$.</p>
<p>

    <img src="/res-nets/residual.png" alt="Residual">
    <figcaption><small>Standard feed forward network (left) and a
network with shortcut connection (right)</small></figcaption>
  </figure>

</p>
<p>So after every conv layer we add this shortcut connection? Well, they decided to
add it after every two $3 \times 3$ conv layers, following the design of the VGG
block. Later experiments performed in [<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>] show that stacking two $3 \times 3$
conv layers works best.</p>
<p>Also, don&rsquo;t forget that we need to add batch normalization and non-linearity
layers after every convolution. All of these layers combined, together with the
shortcut connection, make the residual block (shown on the left side of the
figure below). Note that the second $ReLU$ is applied after adding the shortcut
connection, otherwise the residual function $f(x)$ would be strictly
non-negative, while we want it to take values in $(-\infty, \infty)$. Further
research however showed that this is not the optimal arrangement and for very
deep networks (100+ layers) gradient flow is improved when the non-linearity is
applied only to the residual branch. In their
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027">follow-up paper</a><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> the authors propose
a re-arrangement of the layers addressing this issue while also making the
residual function $f: \mathcal{R} \rightarrow \mathcal{R}$ (shown on the right
side of the figure below).</p>

<p>Since training deep networks could be very expensive the original paper proposes
a so-called <em>&ldquo;bottleneck&rdquo;</em> block for all models deeper than 50 layers. Instead
of two $3 \times 3$ layers, a stack of three layers is used: $1 \times 1$,
$3 \times 3$, $1 \times 1$. The first $1 \times 1$ layer reduces the number of
channels (usually in half) and the $3 \times 3$ layer is a bottleneck operating
with the smaller number of input <em>and</em> output channels. Finally, the second
$1 \times 1$ layer restores the channels back to the input size. Here, again, we
have the option of arranging the batch norm and relu layers in the original
arrangement or in the &lsquo;pre-activation&rsquo; arrangement, although I think that
&lsquo;pre-activation&rsquo; is more common.</p>
<p>

  </figure>

</p>
<p>Note that the second $1 \times 1$ layer actually serves a dual purpose. In
addition to up-scaling the channels it is also used to create a micro-network.</p>
<p>A single $3 \times 3$ conv layer is a linear filter that applies a linear
transformation to the input data. In the
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4400">paper</a><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> <em>&ldquo;Network in network&rdquo;</em>, by Lin
et al. the authors argue that it would be beneficial to replace the single conv
layer with a &ldquo;micro-network&rdquo; structure acting on the same $3 \times 3$ patch.
Now, instead of sliding a linear kernel along the image, we will be sliding the
entire &ldquo;micro-network&rdquo;. Practically, this idea is realized by stacking
$1 \times 1$ layers on top of the $3 \times 3$ layer. In our case we have one
$1 \times 1$ layer resulting in a two-layer fully connected micro network.</p>
<h2 id="the-resnext-block-going-wider-instead-deeper">THE RESNEXT BLOCK: GOING WIDER INSTEAD DEEPER<a href="#the-resnext-block-going-wider-instead-deeper" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Using the ResNet block we can create super deep models (think ~1000 layers) and
now the performance of the model will not degrade. But will it improve? Well,
no. Stacking more layers will improve performance up to some point and beyond
that we only get diminishing returns.</p>
<p>Another way to improve performance is to go wider instead of deeper. What this
means is, instead of stacking more layers, we increase the number of channels in
each of the convolutional layers. This effectively makes our networks learn
features in higher dimensional spaces. This idea is thoroughly explored in the
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07146">paper</a><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> <em>&ldquo;Wide residual networks&rdquo;</em> by
Zagoruyko and Komodakis. A wider network having 50 layers but twice the channels
in each of these layers outperforms the ResNet-152 on ImageNet.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, increasing the number of channels increases the computational
costs quadratically (not speed! since it&rsquo;s parallelizable). To fix this problem
the ResNeXt block was proposed in the
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05431">paper</a><sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> <em>&ldquo;Aggregated residual
transformations for deep neural networks&rdquo;</em> by Xie et al. The idea follows the
<em>split-transform-merge</em> strategy:</p>
<ul>
<li>we first split the channels $C$ of the input into $g$ independent groups;</li>
<li>we then apply different convolutional transformations to each of the groups
producing $g$ outputs, i.e., grouped convolution (supported by DL frameworks);</li>
<li>and, finally, we aggregate the results by concatenating.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <figure>
    <style>

    <img src="/res-nets/resnext.png" alt="ResNeXt block">
    <figcaption><small>ResNext block full diagram (left)
and compressed diagram (right)</small></figcaption>
  </figure>

</p>
<p>The idea of splitting the computation into several groups was inspired by the
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842">Inception network</a><sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>. However, instead
of having every branch perform a different computation (e.g. $3 \times 3$ conv,
$5 \times 5$ conv, etc.), the ResNeXt block performs the same transformation in
all branches. This increases modularity and reduces the number of
hyper-parameters that need to be tuned. Using this approach we greatly reduce
the computational costs <strong>and</strong> the number of parameters while still allowing
for wider networks. Moreover, the authors report that, instead of simply
creating wider networks, it is better to divide the channels into groups.</p>
<p>The downside is that the channels are split into independent groups and no
information is exchanged between them until the final aggregation operation.
For this reason we sandwich the grouped convolution between two $1 \times 1$
conv layers, making the ResNeXt block look a lot like a bottleneck block, but
for entirely different reasons. In the bottleneck block the $1 \times 1$ conv
layers are used for reducing and subsequently increasing the channels, thus
making the $3 \times 3$ conv a bottleneck. Here, however, the $1 \times 1$ conv
layers are used for intermixing the information along the channels before and
after applying the grouped convolution. We don&rsquo;t have to reduce the channels and
have the $3 \times 3$ grouped conv behave like a bottleneck. In fact, the
results of [<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>] show that both reducing (bottleneck) and increasing
(inverted bottleneck) channels degrades the performance.</p>
<p>At the extreme you could use $g=C$ as proposed in [<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>], which means
having each group contain only one channel. Combining this with a $1 \times 1$
convolution afterwards leads to the famous <em>depthwise separable convolution</em>.
This combination leads to a separation of spatial and channel mixing, where
each operation either mixes information across spatial or channel dimension,
but not both. This approach greatly reduces the number of parameters in the
model, but may also harm accuracy.</p>
<h2 id="the-architecture-of-the-resnet">THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE RESNET<a href="#the-architecture-of-the-resnet" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>So the ResNet is constructed by stacking residual blocks one after another, but
there are a few subtleties. A typical conv network is divided into stages and
in each stage several residual blocks are applied, operating on fixed dimensions
$C \times H \times W$ (note that the shortcut connection requires the input
and output dimensions to be the same).</p>
<p>In earlier architectures (e.g. VGG, Inception) the transition between stages was
done with the use of pooling layers (MaxPool, AvgPool). Here we take a different
approach. In every stage the first residual block will be slightly different and
it will be responsible for downscaling the input. The downscaling in the
residual branch will be performed by the $3 \times 3$ conv layer by applying the
filter with a stride of 2. Since we also need to downscale the input in the
identity branch, this will be performed by adding an additional $1 \times 1$
conv layer also with stride 2.</p>
<p>
  <figure>
    <style>
        small {
            font-size: 90%;
        }
    </style>
    <img src="/res-nets/downscale.png" alt="Downscale ResBlock">
    <figcaption><small>Standard downscale
ResBlock (left), Bottleneck downscale ResBlock (middle) and ResNeXt downscale
block (right)</small></figcaption>
  </figure>

</p>
<p>Note that if we are using the &lsquo;pre-activation&rsquo; design then in the identity
branch we need to add a batch norm and a relu layers before the $1 \times 1$
convolution.</p>
<p>The final ResNet architecture consists of stacking ResBlocks, with occasionally
downscaling the image with Downscale ResBlocks. After that a Global average
pooling layer is applied as proposed in [<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>]. The original idea was to have
the final convolution produce a tensor with the same number of channels as the
number of classes, each channel corresponding to a confidence map for the given
class. Replacing FC layers with global average pooling would not be as effective
if were using linear convolutions instead of micro-networks. Later models,
however, take a less extreme approach and add one more FC layer to scale the
output to match the number of classes.</p>
<p>The number of stages should be such that the spatial dimensions of the tensor
are reduced to approx. $8 \times 8$. For CIFAR-10, for example, we need 3
stages. For ImageNet what is done in practice is that the very first convolution
is a $7 \times 7$ conv layer with stride of 2, scaling the input from
$224 \times 224$ to $112 \times 112$. Then 4 stages are applied further reducing
the size to $112 / 2^4 = 7 \times 7$.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>However, we still need to choose the channels for each stage
$C_1, C_2, C_3, \dots$, the blocks within each stage $B_1, B_2, B_3, \dots$,
and also the groups within each block (if using ResNeXt blocks)
$g_1, g_2, g_3, \dots$. Exploring the possible combinations to find the best
solution is clearly infeasible, but there are a few guiding principles that we
can use. The paper<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> <em>&ldquo;Designing network design spaces&rdquo;</em> by Iliya
Radosavovic et al. explores what the relation between these parameters should
be, so that models at any scale would perform well. This lead to the design of
the RegNet and the following principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not use any bottleneck.</li>
<li>Share the number of groups for all stages, i.e., $g_i = g \quad \forall i$.</li>
<li>Increase the number of channels across stages, i.e., $C_{i+1} \geq C_i$.
In practice channels are usually doubled at every stage, however the authors
report top performance at $C_{i+1} \approx 2.5 C_i$.</li>
<li>Increase the number of blocks in each stage, i.e., $B_{i+1} \geq B_i$, but
not necessarily in the last stage. The pattern 1:1:3:1 is rather famous for
networks with four stages.</li>
<li>Best performing models are usually around 20 blocks deep in total, and the
other parameters are used to control the number of FLOPs.</li>
